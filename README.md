# Skibidi Vibe Map

## About the Project  
**Skibidi Vibe Map** is my first ever submission to a hackathon (hackaton link provided here: https://brainrot-jia-seed-hackathon.devpost.com/). I have very little coding experience but I love to challenge myself! The submission is supposed to be playful, chaotic web app designed to delightfully derail your productivity. Instead of helping you stay on task, it delivers absurd responses and memes to ensure you're thoroughly distracted. This project blends humor, randomness, and internet culture into a unique and interactive experience.

## Features  
- **Chaotic Task Suggestions**  
  Enter a task, and you'll receive hilariously nonsensical instructions inspired by brainrot vibes!  

- **Meme Integration**  
  Every response is paired with a random meme to enhance the hilarity! 

- **Purposeful Distraction**  
  Skibidi Vibe Map leans into internet humor and chaos, making it the perfect antidote to mundane work routines!
